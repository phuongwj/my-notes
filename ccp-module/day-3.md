## Innovation Waves 

When we're talking about **Innovation Waves**, we're talking about **Kondratiev waves** (aka Innovation Waves or K-Waves) are hypothesized cycle-like phenomena in the global world economy.

The phenomenno is closely connected with Technology life cycles.

Each awve irreversibly changes the society on a global scale. The idea here being said is that the latest wave is **Cloud Technology**, or other things like ML/AI but maybe they're all part of the same waves or separate waves, but general they're broken up based on the **PRDE**

This is a common pattern of a wave change of **supply** and **demand**:

So if we're seeing this, we know that we are in a wave and where we are in a wave.



## Burning Platform

**Burning Platform** is a term used when a company abandons old technology for new technology with the uncertainty of success and can be motivated by fear that the organization future survival hinges no its **digital transformation**.



## Digital Transformation Checklist 

You can get to this website by either searching "Digital Transformation Checklist", then it'll lead you to the "Public Sector Digital Transformation" page and you'll be able to get the pdf (however, as of the current time I'm writing this note, the pdf has been archived!).



## Evolution of Computing Power

### What is Computing Power?

The throughout measured at which a computer can complete a computational task. A few examples of computing:

- General Computing
- GPU Computing 
- Quantum Computing 

The idea is we're not done with the evolution of computing power, things are going to geta lot faster once we solve things. 

### AWS Service Offering

- Elastic Compute Cloud EC2.
- AWS Inferentiare (Inf1).
- AWS Brakcet (for this one, you can actually use Quantum Computing as a service).



## Amazon Bracket

You can use Quantum Computing on AWS! It is accessible. You just need to sign-in to AWS console and search *Bracket* then you'll be making your way over to something called *Amazon Bracket*.

On the side bar, you can set up *Quantum tasks* then do further stuffs if you need.
