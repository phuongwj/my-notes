# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Study Notes

This module contains the notes Iâ€™ve taken while preparing for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. The content is based on the [freeCodeCamp YouTube video by Andrew Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhDYbskXRgc&t=6488s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).

Feel free to browse through the notes and use them as a reference, but please double-check the information with official AWS resources or additional study materials to ensure accuracy.
