# day-2 / Getting Started
before reading, i recommend you to switch to a lighter appearance, since it will make reading this easier.

1. Create an AWS Account and then sign-in.
2. Go ahead and search IAM (aka Identity and Access Management) then click on it.
3. Add MFA.
4. Create an Account Alias.
5. Go under *Access management* on the sidebar and go to *Users* then *Create user*.



## Creating a User

**Step 1:**

- Enter in your name and check the box *Provide user access to the AWS Management Console*.
- Choose *I want to create an IAM user* for *User type* since you want to have *Programmatic access*.
- You can either pick *Autogenerated pasword* or *Custom password* for the *Console password* section. After that, go ahead click *Next*. 
- You can also pick *Users must create a new password at next sign in*.

**Step 2:**

- Go ahead create a group.
- For the group name, you can call it *Admin*, since it's pretty common to call a group like that.
- Looking down we'll see a bunch of Policies.

> **Aside -- Information about Policiies:**
> - The first policy, which is *AdministratorAccess*, as you can see in the > > *Description* label, it basically gives you nearly almost the same capabilities as the > AWS root user account. You can go ahead check that box.
> - If we hit on the dropdown menu called *Filter by Type*, and go to *AWS managed - job function*.
> + They're basically pre-made AWS Policies that you could apply to different users. 
> + What's really popular after the *AdministratorAccess* is the *PowerUserAccess*
> - *PowerUserAccess* allows a user to basically do anything they want with the exception of management of users and groups.
> + Checking that box or not is up to you.

**Continuing Step 2:**

- Go ahead hit *Create User Group*


**Step 3:**

- You can create tags if you want, otherwise you won't have to.
- Just do *Create User*.

**Step 4:**

- In this step, you basically have received your *Console sign-in details* so go ahead 
- One thing about this is that it won't automatically create a something called *Access key* for you. So just close the window and follow the steps below if you want to create your *Access key*.

> **Aside - How to create your own Access Key:**
> - If you've been following the steps above and have closed the window, you'll see right away a spot telling you to *Create access key* in the *Summary* box.
> - If not, you can navigate as follow
> `Access management > Users > Choose your username > Look for Summary panel > Create access key`

 
## Heading over to IAM Dashboard

- On the right side, inside the *AWS Account* panel, we can see our *Account ID*, we can also save that ID somewhere as well.
- Now once you've *Created a User* following the steps above, log out of your account and sign-in as an **IAM User** using what you've just created. 
+ This is the recommended way of doing, signing in as an **IAM User** and not a **Root user**.
- Once signed out and currently signing back in, it's prompting you to create a new password. Therefore, go ahead and create a new one.
+ Note: When creating a new password, using a Password Generator is recommended!
- You'll then be logged in again but also sign out again to make sure your new password works. 
- Once you finished all those steps above, you should see that on the top right corner, now you'll know that if it's showing `[Your IAM User] @ [Account Alias] `, that means you're logged in with your IAM User Account, and not your Root Account. 
+ It's your *AWS Account Display Info* if you're wondering.
- You'll also see that on the top right corner, next to your *AWS Account Display Info*, there's a dropdown menu showing a bunch of regions. 
- For whatever regions you have, the default regions will be based on your locality. 
- It's strongly recommend that we should run in *us-east-1* because it's the original region, and it also has the most access to AWS Services.
+ Some AWS Services, such as billings, costs and things like that, are only going to show up in *us-east-1*. 
+ For example: If you try to search services like *CloudFront*, *S3*, you'll see that they don't require region selection. However, if you do search up services like *EC2*, it does have region dependencies. 
+ **Main point here is just to be careful with regions and stuffs like that, it could automatically switch up on you.**
