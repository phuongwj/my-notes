## About the Intro to Algorithmic Problem Solving Course

ShiftKey Labs have been offering a variety of courses and one of them is "Intro to Algorithmic Problem Solving". The course name is pretty self-explanatory, but it's for:
- Developing structured problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Learn to communicate algorithm ideas clearly
- Analyze complexity and optimize solutions
- Build a strong foundation through hands-on, Leet-style challenges

## What is this module about?

As a participant for this course, I created this module with the purpose of documenting the slides/assignments I've received from the course, as well as solutions I've submitted for the assignments. 

Unlike other modules where I write my own notes, for this module, I straight up used the notes given from the slides, and if there are any necessary tweaks or extra notes that are needed, I will add them in!
